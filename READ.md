# Sarah Paitz Portfolio


# Description
This is my current portfolio. It contains a homepage where you can find a short bio with links to my linkedin and github accounts.

You can see all of my projects and homework assignments by going to the portfolio page. The contact page allows you to contact me and in the future I would like to add a music resume and showcase some of my works as a musician as well.
