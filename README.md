# Sarah Paitz Portfolio

# Description
This application is my current portfolio. It contains a homepage where you can find a short bio and my resume along with links to my linkedin and github accounts.

You can see all of my projects and homework assignments on the portfolio page. There is a contact page to get in touch with me and in the future I would like to add a music page/music resume page as well to showcase my work as a musician.
